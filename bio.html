        <p>Ternopil, Ukraine, the end of the 90s. The family that lives on the 
        suburbs of the regional center:
        a father, a mother and a little daughter. On one of April nights, after
        Dynamo Kyiv sensational campaign

        in this story.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Systematic Age (as a real person - Yurij Lishchuk) spent all his 
        lifetime in his hometown - Ternopil, where he was fulfilled by spirits 
        of urban atmosphere of Ternopil panel houses.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Yurij has studied eleven years at the school №29 where he not 
        just get a lot of knowledge from teachers but he also began to write 
        poems. At first, he was not so good at them but shortly after he made

        <br>
        
        <p>Themes of his poets are very different: from love to war, from 
        history to inner, from pain to power, etc. In general, Systematic 
        Age's poems contain not only expressions, feelings, anger but also 
        valuable facts that maybe nobody knew about before.</p>
